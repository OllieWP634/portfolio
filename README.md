Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Oliver Peers, 21 year old student of computer science at the University of Liverpool, currently competing my MSc.

My portfolio here was made entirely with HTML and CSS. Where I showcase projects that I have undertaken during my undergraduate studies at University.
