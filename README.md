# Portfolio Website  
*A personal portfolio built to showcase software and research projects.*

## Overview  
This project serves as a central hub for my academic and personal work across computer science and engineering.  
The site highlights selected projects demonstrating my skills in **software development**, **machine learning**, and **data systems**.

Developed initially using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, the site is being redeveloped in **React** for improved modularity, performance, and scalability.

## Tech Stack  
- **Languages:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Frameworks:** React (in progress)
- **Tools:** Git, VS Code (planned deployment)

## Features  
- Responsive and accessible design for desktop and mobile
- Dedicated project pages with technical descriptions and links to source code
- Clean UI to emphasise readability and presentation
- Planned React-based architecture for reusable components and smoother navigation

## Key Projects Highlighted  
- **Neural Networks for Anaerobic Digestion** – Deep learning model calibration for biokinetic systems using TensorFlow and HPC pipelines.
- **Algorithmic and Database Systems (MSc Coursework)** – Implementation of efficient algorithms and distributed SQL processing using Spark.
- **Structural Engineering Computation (VBA & MATLAB)** – Engineering analysis tools for soil and truss systems using programmatic modelling.

## Learning Outcomes  
- Strengthened web development fundamentals (DOM, CSS layout, responsive design)  
- Practised clean code principles and version control using Git  
- Gained experience structuring a project for scalability using React components  

## Project Status  
🚧 **React redevelopment ongoing**  
The static JavaScript version is complete, and a modular React rebuild is currently under development.
