# Portfolio Website
*A personal portfolio built to showcase software and research projects.*

## Overview  
This project serves as a central hub for my academic and personal work across computer science and engineering.
The site highlights selected projects demonstrating my skills in **software development**, **machine learning**, and **data systems**.

Developed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

## Tech Stack
- **Languages:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Libraries** Particles.js
- **Tools:** Git

## Features
- Responsive and accessible design for desktop and mobile
- Dedicated project pages with technical descriptions and links to source code
- Clean UI to emphasise readability and presentation
- Planned React-based architecture for reusable components and smoother navigation

## Key Projects Highlighted
- **Neural Networks for Anaerobic Digestion** – Deep learning model calibration for biokinetic systems using TensorFlow and HPC pipelines
- **Structural Engineering Analysis Tool** – Automated geotechnical and truss calculations in VBA
- **Income Data Analysis Tool** – Analysed key disparities between salary postings of graduates post university
- **LogBox - Film Logging** - LogBox is a web application that allows users to log, rate, and reflect on their favourite films

## Learning Outcomes
