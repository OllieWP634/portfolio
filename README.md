# Oliver Peers - Portfolio

I'm an MSc Computer Science student at the University of Liverpool with a First-Class background in Civil Engineering. I’m passionate about applying analytical problem-solving to real-world software challenges — from data processing and algorithm design to front-end development.

### Current Focus
Seeking a Software Engineering or Data Science placement (2025-2026) to apply my skills in Python, JavaScript, and large-scale data systems, while contributing to efficient, scalable software solutions.

### Technical Skills
- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, C, SQL, HTML, CSS  
- **Frameworks & Tools:** React, TensorFlow, Spark, Pandas, Git  
- **Focus Areas:** Software Development, Algorithmic Design, Data Systems, HPC Workflows

### Software Projects
**Neural Networks for Anaerobic Digestion**  
Developed deep learning models using Python and TensorFlow to estimate ADM1 parameters from synthetic data. Trained on Barkla HPC, achieving high predictive accuracy (MSE 4.0×10⁻⁷). Produced a reproducible workflow and technical report demonstrating scalable model calibration.

**Algorithmic and Database Systems** *(MSc Coursework)*  
Implemented efficient algorithmic solutions in Python with time/space analysis. Designed and queried relational databases using SQL and Spark for distributed data processing.

**Portfolio Website**  
Built a responsive project showcase using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (React version in progress). Designed to highlight key projects and technical growth.
