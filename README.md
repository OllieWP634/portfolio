# portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Oliver Peers, 21 year old student at the University of Liverpool, currently completing my MSc in computer science. Starting to sink my teeth into web development, while having prior experience at university working on a machine learning algorithm.

My portfolio here was made entirely with HTML and CSS. Showcasing projects that I have undertaken during my undergraduate studies at University.
